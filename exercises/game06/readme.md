# Final Project: Horror Game
The goal of this horror game is to find the key
that lets you escape the haunted house you've found yourself
trapped in without dying. The house is a series of corridors with various
furniture and paintings with minimal lighting. House will be made using probuilder.
Sound effects will be added for:
* Footsteps
* Opening doors / Cabinets
* Taking damage
* Ambient sounds
* Turning your flashlight on and off
To see where you're going and to prevent paranormal beings from 
attacking you, you must make sure that your flashlight cannot be 
turned off for too long. Keep in mind, though, that it does have 
a limited battery.
## 3 Targets
### Low bar:
* The haunted house has lots of furniture, 1 of which contains the key.
* There is a UI meter for the flashlight's battery 
* Sound effect plus UI flash of some sort to indicate taking damage 
* There will be 1 paranormal being that will try to kill you 
* Running out of battery will immediately spawn in the paranormal being
### Medium bar
* Boxes / cabinets in the house can be opened and will have items inside
* Items include notes for the player to read and batteries
* Clicking on paintings will trigger certain events
* Paranormal beings will randomly come into the player's view to spook them
### High bar
* Looking directly at paranormal beings will give the player blurred vision and other negative debuffs
* While walking, the player camera bobs up and down slightly
* An attempt at jump scare events that don't actually kill the player
