# Final Project: Horror Game
The goal of this horror game is to find the key
that lets you escape the haunted house you've found yourself
trapped inside. The house is a series of corridors with various
furniture and minimal lighting. House will be made using probuilder.
To see where you're going, you must have your flashlight on. 
Keep in mind, though, that it does have 
a limited battery.
Sound effects will be added for:
* Footsteps
* Opening doors / Cabinets
* Ambient sounds
* Turning your flashlight on and off
* Paranormal sounds
## 3 Targets
### Low bar:
* The haunted house has lots of furniture, 1 of which contains the key.
* There is a UI meter for the flashlight's battery 
* Sound sort of UI flash to indicate taking damage 
* There will be 1 paranormal being that will try to kill you 
* Running out of battery will immediately cause you to lose the game
### Medium bar
* Boxes / cabinets in the house can be opened and will have items inside
* Items such as notes and a key can be interacted with
* Two paranormal beings will be present in the house
* One of the paranormal beings chases you once you've found the key
### High bar
* Looking directly at paranormal beings will give the player blurred vision and other negative debuffs
* While walking, the player camera bobs up and down slightly
* An attempt at jump scare events that don't actually kill the player
* More in game items can be interacted with (Lamps, pillows, TV remotes, etc)
