# Simple RTS Styled Game (Revised)
The goal of game05 is to build up your base, 
create an army of units, and eliminate an enemy weapons research facility.
You start with your main building, from which 
you will be able to construct buildings that can:
create units, extract resources from the ground, 
generate power, and increase your technology level.
Buildings will require power to run as well as natural
resources to build. Certain buildings and units can only
be unlocked once you have hit a certain tech level.
Features that will (hopefully) be implemented:
* A UI for the main building with buttons that constructs other buildings
* Player can click where on the ground they wish to construct buildings
* A standard move order and an attack order for units
* An attack order that only causes units to attack if they are within range
* Units meant for harvesting resources will automatically do so when standing on them
* Different unit types with different value speed, range, and damage
